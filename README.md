# **Face Recognition System using InsightFace and SVM**  

This project is a real-time **face recognition system** using **InsightFace** for face detection and alignment, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** for classification. It consists of three main scripts:

1. **`add_face.py`** ‚Äì Automatically captures and saves 100+ face embeddings per person.  
2. **`train_model.py`** ‚Äì Trains an SVM classifier using stored embeddings.  
3. **`face_recognition.py`** ‚Äì Recognizes faces in real time and labels unknown faces.

## **Features**
‚úÖ **Automatic Face Enrollment:** Captures and saves 100 face samples per person.  
‚úÖ **Real-Time Face Recognition:** Detects and classifies faces from a webcam feed.  
‚úÖ **SVM-Based Classification:** Uses Support Vector Machines for better accuracy.  
‚úÖ **Confidence Thresholding:** Unknown faces are labeled "Unknown" based on a confidence threshold.  
‚úÖ **High Accuracy with InsightFace:** Uses deep learning-based embeddings for robust recognition.

## **Installation**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition-system.git
   cd face-recognition-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy opencv-python insightface scikit-learn joblib
   ```

## **Usage**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Add New Faces (`add_face.py`)**
Automatically enrolls a person by capturing 100+ face samples.

```bash
python add_face.py
```
- Enter the person‚Äôs name when prompted.
- The script captures multiple samples and saves the embeddings.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Train the Model (`train_model.py`)**
Once enough faces are enrolled, train the classifier.

```bash
python train_model.py
```
- Trains an SVM model using the collected face embeddings.
- Saves the trained model as `face_classifier.pkl`.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Start Face Recognition (`face_recognition.py`)**
Run real-time face recognition with a confidence threshold.

```bash
python face_recognition.py
```
- Recognizes stored faces.
- Unknown faces are labeled `"Unknown"` if confidence is too low.

---

## **Configuration**
- **Adjust Confidence Threshold:** Change `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` in `face_recognition.py` to fine-tune recognition accuracy.
- **Modify Sample Count:** Change `sample_target` in `add_face.py` to collect more than 100 samples.
